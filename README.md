# pizzaHub

## A pizza ordering website that allows you to choose what kind of items you would like, then displays places that have that pizza and a breakdown 
## of the costs of each of those places.
## For example if you order 14" pepperoni it would be at most places so it would display the price for the base pizza and for the pepperoni
## but if you wanted a 2 liter of Pepsi with your order that would make half of the options disapear that only have coke products. I hope to eventually 
## have an api system that allows one to order through the place of their own and complete the order
